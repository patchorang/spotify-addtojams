Script to add currently playing song to a predefined playlist in Spotify

I keep a running playlist each month in Spotify. When I like a song I add it to that playlist. This gives me monthly playlists based on what I liked at the time. It's a great way for music discovery. 

This script allows me to automatically add the currently playing song to that playlist. I have a shell script that calls the Python script. The shell script is called by a hotkey with automator.
